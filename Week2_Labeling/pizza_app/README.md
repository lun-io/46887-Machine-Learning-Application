# Slice Street Pizza: feedback app (starter)

Imagine you run a pizza company. Customers leave feedback, you store it, and you analyze the
data later. The app has two tabs.

**Customer tab:** type a comment and choose a star rating (1 to 5). The app labels the comment
(positive or negative) and saves it to `feedback.csv`.

**Owner tab:** the analysis, which shows:
1. how many comments are positive vs negative,
2. the average star rating for each label,
3. the comments to read carefully: a positive label with a low rating, or a negative label
   with a high rating (or a label that is unclear).

The app starts empty. Add comments live. `demo_comments.csv` has 20 fictional comments with
ratings that you can type in (or copy from) to fill it up.

## Files
- `app.py`: the Streamlit app
- `labeler.py`: the function that asks the LLM for a label
- `logo.png`, `logo.svg`: the company logo
- `demo_comments.csv`: sample comments to type in, not loaded automatically
- `requirements.txt`: packages Streamlit Cloud installs for you

## Run it online for free (no terminal)
1. Put these files in a public GitHub repository (upload them in the browser).
2. On share.streamlit.io, create an app from the repository, main file `app.py`.
3. Under Advanced settings, add a secret: `GROQ_API_KEY = "your key"` (a free Groq key, no credit card).
Saved files can disappear when the app restarts, so use the Download CSV button.

## If something goes wrong
- `KeyError: 'GROQ_API_KEY'` means the secret is missing or named differently. Add it under the app's Secrets.
- A 404 error means the model was retired. Find a current one at console.groq.com/docs/models and change `MODEL` in `labeler.py`.
- A 429 error means too many requests. Wait a minute and try again.
